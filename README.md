# Incorrect Conditional Rendering Logic in React useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications involving incorrect conditional rendering logic within the useEffect hook. The component uses useState to manage a count variable, updating it with each button click.  The useEffect hook then attempts to conditionally log messages to the console based on the count value. However, there's a flaw in how the conditional logic is implemented, leading to unexpected and potentially incorrect behavior.

## Problem

The issue lies in the logic within the useEffect hook. The conditional statement `if (count > 5)` correctly checks if the count is greater than 5, but the logic in the `else` block is always executed. This means that the correct message will not always be logged to the console.  The dependency array `[count]` is correctly used, but the conditional logic inside the useEffect is incorrect.
